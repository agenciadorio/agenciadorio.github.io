== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why Medusa? =
 
Medusa is NO more just a Website Cleaning Plugin. We will include Useful Functions and Tools for Speed, Security and more.

= Is Defer Booster Code Compatible with my Theme? =
 
Yes. We tested the plugin on several Themes. Is 99.9% Compatible with any Theme.

= What is HeartBeat? =

As the name indicates the heartbeat API sends continuous pulse to perform periodic tasks. All hosting companies follow a general policy of sending a warning email when the CPU utilization of the hosting server exceeds certain limit. WP Speed Grades Lite Changes HeartBeat Pulse to from 15 to 60 Seconds. This will help to reduce the server load and save hosting cost.
