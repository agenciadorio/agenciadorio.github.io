Cache Images is a plugin that gives users option to sideload images that are hosted on other domains to their own site. Sideloaded images are added to WordPress media library so you can use all tools related to images that you can use with images uploaded through WordPress. Image will be added as an attachment of first post where it is found, and every post where original URL is occurring will be updated with new URL. User can select from which domains to sideload images, including Blogger's domains.

It uses AJAX so it means you can sideload large number of images even on slow servers. (AJAX functions are made by fork of code from plugin [AJAX Thumbnail Rebuild](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-thumbnail-rebuild/))

This plugin is fully internationalized. You can find .pot file in <em>languages</em> folder where you should place your translation. Current translations are Serbian and Spanish. Please send your translation by [contacting author](http://blog.milandinic.com/contact/) so that it can be included it in next releases.
