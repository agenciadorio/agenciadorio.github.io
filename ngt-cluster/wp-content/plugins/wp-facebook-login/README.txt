Facebook Login for WordPress simple adds a facebook login button into wp-login.php and let you use facebook avatars. BuddyPress compatible

== Description ==

If you just need a facebook login button in your wp-login.php to login/register users, this is your plugin. Lightweight plugin that won't bloat your site with unnecessary functions. Developer friendly and easy to expand.

To add facebook button on a page use shortcode `[fbl_login_button redirect="" hide_if_logged="" size="large" type="continue_with" show_face="true"]`

More info about the button on https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web/login-button

If you need to add a facebook login in your template or link a Facebook account to an existing profile use the following code:

```<?php do_action('facebook_login_button');?>```

If you want to show a disconnect button to remove facebook connection from a user profile and avatar use this:

```<?php do_action('facebook_disconnect_button');?>```

= Configuration =
