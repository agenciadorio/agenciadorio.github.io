A responsive fullscreen mobile menu navigation. Activate it for your custom made theme to save some time.

== Description ==

Settings:

* Mobile location
* Mobile breakpoint
* Background color
* Text brightness
* Logo as text or image
* Logo and menu font family
* Disable navigation, menu location, CSS, javascript
* Hide on scroll, on or off
* Custom CSS

If you don't want the HTML to go through the action wp_footer, place this somewhere after the beginning of your body-tag: `<?php do_action('mn_nav'); ?>`. It might be better for readability and perhaps SEO.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `mobile-navigation` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or use the plugin installer in wp-admin.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to `Options` > `Mobile Navigation` and set your settings. Be sure to choose a menu that is not empty.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Mobile Navigation work with every theme? =

No. Some themes has some strange CSS and javascript. If another mobile menu tries to be on top there might be a conflict.

= Why not put more settings? =

I try to keep the settings down. It should just be enough to adapt it to your site in terms of colors and fonts.

= Why doesn't it work? =

Make sure you have the actions wp_head() and wp_footer() in your theme. If you have too large screen compared to the breakpoint in your settings the menu is not shown.

= Why is the CSS generated as file?

It's not a good practice to have CSS generated inline. You can disable the CSS if you prefer adding your own.
